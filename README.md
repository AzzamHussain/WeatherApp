# Weather Application Using Open Weather API

## Project Overview

### Description:
The Weather Application is a mobile app designed to provide real-time weather updates based on the user's current location. Utilizing the Open Weather API, this app fetches and displays the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and weather description. 

Although the UI was designed to display global weather updates, the application is currently limited to showing weather data for the user's current location due to the API's data constraints.

### Purpose:
The primary goal of developing this weather application was to practice API integration and enhance UI development skills. This project serves as a practical exercise in connecting a Flutter application with a live API and presenting the data in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.

## Project Details

### Project Background:
This project was initiated to improve my skills in API integration and UI development within Flutter. By working with real-time data and focusing on a polished user interface, I aimed to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing application.

### Development Process:
The development followed an iterative process, including:
1. **Planning**: Defining the scope and requirements for the weather application.
2. **Design**: Creating wireframes and design mockups for the UI.
3. **Development**: Implementing the UI and integrating the Open Weather API for data fetching.
4. **Testing**: Conducting thorough testing to ensure accurate data display and a smooth user experience.

### Challenges and Solutions:
- **API Integration**: Handling asynchronous data fetching from the Open Weather API using Flutter's FutureBuilder and async-await patterns.
- **Location Services**: Implementing location services to fetch and display weather data for the user's current location.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the application is responsive and functional across different devices using Flutter's layout widgets.
